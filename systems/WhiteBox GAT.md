# Research "WhiteBox GAT"

Whitebox Geospatial Analysis Tools (GAT) is a cross-platform, open-source Geographic Information System (GIS) and remote sensing software package designed for geospatial analysis and data visualization in research and education[^1]. It is developed by members of the University of Guelph Centre for Hydrogeomatics[^1]. Whitebox GAT was initially created as a replacement for the Terrain Analysis System (TAS)[^1].

**Core Functionalities**

- **Analysis Tools:** Whitebox GAT has more than 385 tools for spatial analysis of raster data sets, including cost-distance analysis, buffering, distance operations, weighted overlays, and more[^1]. It is especially good at LiDAR, image processing, and hydrological analysis[^2].
- **Hydrology Tools:** Includes DEM preprocessing, flow direction and accumulation, watershed extraction, and mass flux analysis[^1]. It has been fine-tuned for hydro-geomorphic applications, such as modeling surface drainage patterns, delineating watersheds, and analyzing stream networks[^2].
- **Terrain Analysis Tools:** Capabilities include surface derivatives (slope, aspect, and curvatures), hillshading, wetness index, and relative stream power index[^1].
- **LiDAR Tools:** For editing and viewing LiDAR data, including converting LAS to shapefiles, displaying LiDAR point clouds, creating LiDAR footprints, and interpolating LiDAR into DEM or DSM[^2].
- **Image Processing Tools:** Offers k-means classification, spatial filters, image mosaicing, NDVI, resampling, contrast enhancement, multi-spectral data analysis, classification, and change detection[^1][^4].

**Ease of Use and Learning Curve**

Whitebox GAT is often praised for its consistent design and ease of use[^3]. Its simple and intuitive interface makes it suitable for performing quick analyses, even for users with limited GIS experience[^5]. The toolbar and menu structures are designed for simplicity, with most tools accessed through a toolbox "treeview" structure[^4].

**Data Formats Supported**

The software supports both raster and vector (shapefile) data structures. It also offers extensive functionality for processing laser scanner (LiDAR) data containing LAS files[^1].

**Scalability and Performance**

Whitebox GAT is designed to process large raster datasets[^4]. Several tools use algorithms that perform parallel processing to improve the performance of computationally intensive tasks[^4]. It has been used to process large digital elevation models containing over one billion grid cells[^4].

**Integration Capabilities**

Whitebox GAT is extendable, allowing users to create and add custom tools or plugins using any JVM language[^1]. It also supports scripting using Groovy, JavaScript, and Python[^1]. Plugins can be called from scripts to carry out advanced geoprocessing workflows and task automation[^4].

**Pricing and Licensing**

Whitebox GAT is distributed under the GNU General Public License, making it an open-source software package[^1]. As such, it is available for free[^7].

**Community and Support**

The Whitebox GAT project was initiated as a replacement for the Terrain Analysis System (TAS)[^1]. The software has been translated into 11 languages, with over 21,000 downloads[^2]. Users can request new tools or features via the GitHub repository[^3].
