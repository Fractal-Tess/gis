# QGIS 3

## Overview

QGIS (Quantum GIS) is a _free and open-source_ geographic information system (GIS) software that supports viewing, editing, and analysis of geospatial data.

## Core Functionalities

QGIS (Quantum GIS) stands out in the realm of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) due to its extensive core functionalities and flexibility, making it a preferred choice for many users. Below are the key features that differentiate QGIS from other GIS systems:

**1. Open Source and Cross-Platform Compatibility**

- QGIS is free and open-source, allowing users to modify and distribute the software. It operates on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android, which broadens accessibility for various users[^104].

**2. Extensive Data Management Capabilities**

- Users can create, edit, manage, and export vector and raster data in numerous formats without requiring conversion to a common format. This includes support for various file types and integration with spatial databases[^101][^102].

**3. Advanced Spatial Analysis Tools**

- QGIS provides a comprehensive suite of spatial analysis tools, including vector analysis, geoprocessing, and geometry management. The integration of GRASS GIS functionalities adds over 400 modules for advanced geospatial processing[^102][^104].

**4. Powerful Plugin Architecture**

- The extensible plugin system allows users to enhance QGIS's capabilities significantly. Users can create custom plugins using Python or C++, tailoring the software to their specific needs[^101][^104].

**5. Rich Visualization Options**

- QGIS supports advanced rendering options for visualizing data. Users can employ various styles and symbols to represent data effectively. The expression builder allows for dynamic labeling and styling based on attribute values, which is more flexible compared to some other GIS platforms[^106].

**6. Integrated Python Console**

- The built-in Python console facilitates scripting and automation within QGIS, enabling users to perform complex tasks programmatically. This feature enhances efficiency in data manipulation and analysis[^101][^103].

**7. Comprehensive Mapping Tools**

- QGIS includes robust mapping capabilities with tools for composing maps, creating layouts, and generating print-ready outputs. The Atlas feature allows users to automate map production based on layer attributes, providing a unique advantage over competitors[^106].

**8. Support for Web Services**

- QGIS can function as a client for various web services (WMS, WFS, etc.) and can also serve as a WMS server. This capability enables easy sharing of geospatial data over the internet[^102][^104].

## Additional tools

QGIS can be extended with numerous plugins, for example:

- **GRASS GIS Integration**
- **SAGA GIS Integration**
- **Processing Framework**
- **QuickMapServices**
- **GeoCoding**
- **Database Manager**
- **Topology Checker**
- **Spatial Query**
- **Point Sampling Tool**
- **QField Sync**
- **DataPlotly**
- **QGIS2Web**
- **QuickOSM**
- **Network Analysis**
- **Time Manager**

## Ease of Use & Learning Curve
