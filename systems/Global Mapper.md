# Research "Global Mapper"

Global Mapper is a GIS software known for its wide array of spatial datasets and analysis tools[^1]. It caters to both GIS professionals and new users, serving as a spatial data management tool and an integral part of enterprise-wide GIS systems[^1][^5].

**Core Functionalities**

- **LiDAR Module:** Advanced LiDAR processing tools, including point cloud classification[^1][^5].
- **Terrain Analysis:** View shed modeling, watershed delineation, volume measurement[^1][^2].
- **Data Creation and Editing:** Tools for drawing, image rectification, and vectorization[^1][^2].
- **Raster and Vector Data Creation and Editing:** Offers tools for drawing, image rectification, and vectorization[^1][^2][^5].
- **Attribute Management:** Provides full attribute editing and processing functionality, including search, search and replace, tabular file joining, and attribute calculation[^2].
- **Feature Extraction:** Extracts vector area features from raster or elevation layers based on color, elevation, or slope[^2].
- **Density Grid Calculation:** Creates colorized density or heat maps from point datasets[^2].
- **Sea Level Rise Calculation:** Computes areas covered by rising water levels[^2].
- **Digitizing:** Vast array of digitizing tools for creating and/or editing features on the map[^2].

**Ease of Use \& Learning Curve**

Global Mapper is designed with an intuitive user interface[^5]. The logical layout aims to smooth the learning curve[^5]. The software provides various ways to access tools, such as menus, toolbars, and keyboard shortcuts[^4]. Toolbars can be customized[^2][^4].

**Data Formats Supported**

Global Mapper supports a large number of geospatial data formats[^5][^6]. It can read, write, and analyze almost all spatial data and offers direct access to common spatial databases[^1][^5].

**Scalability and Performance**

Global Mapper offers tools for batch processing, allowing multiple files to be converted, reprojected, gridded, and renamed[^2].

**Integration Capabilities**

Global Mapper can directly publish maps to MangoMap, an online map service[^1].

**Pricing and Licensing**

The Global Mapper LiDAR Module is offered at a lower price than similar applications, with flexible licensing options for network, enterprise, and academic use[^1].

**Community \& Support**

Global Mapper is continuously updated with new features and functions[^1].
